# Playground Project

## Platform for cooperative storytelling in form of written roleplays

### To-Dos

Extend User Model:

* Users have descriptions to show what they are searching
* Users have a nickname

Make Models and Relations:

* Users have rpgs and characters
* rpgs have descriptions
* rpgs contain posts
* posts are linked to one character
* the characters on an rpg have to be choosen/linked

Nice to have later on:

* locations which can be added by users and linked to rpgs
